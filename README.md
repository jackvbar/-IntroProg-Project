-IntroProg-Project
==================

First repository project on GitHub
 -This project will eventually become a coded game project for the "Introduction to Programming" course at Marist College.
 -I have created a simple home page for the "Adventure Game" with the following code...
<!--Create a simple web page for new project-->
<!-- John Barry-->
<html>
    <head>
      <title>John's Game</title>
    <script>
      alert("Welcome to John's Adventure Game");
    </script>
    </head>
<body>
<h1 style="text-align:center"><span style="color:Black"><big><u>JavaScript Adventure Game</u></big></span></h1>
